## What is Leet (1337)
also known as eleet or leetspeak, is a system of modified spellings and verbiage used primarily on the Internet for many[citation needed] phonetic languages. It uses some ASCII characters to replace Latinate characters in ways that play on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain words based on a system of suffixes and alternate meanings.
